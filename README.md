# C++ Basics Practice

This repository contains small, topic-wise C++ programs used to explore fundamental concepts such as input/output, bitwise operations, logical operators, and floating-point precision.

## Topics Covered
1. Character Input (`cin.get`)
2. Integer & String Input (with `getline`)
3. Character Arrays and `strlen`
4. ASCII values
5. Logical Operators (`&&`, `||`)
6. Bitwise Operations (`~`, `bitset`)
7. Floating Point Precision and Epsilon Comparison

## How to Compile
```bash
g++ basics.cpp -o basics
./basics
